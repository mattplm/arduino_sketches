#+TITLE: Arduino experiences

In this repository will lie some (very) small arduino projects. Most
of the sketches in you will find here will be built to test some
components found in basic Arduino kits (leds, small motors, IR
sensors...). The repository is just there as a reminder for the stuff
I may (will) forget.
