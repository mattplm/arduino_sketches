#+TITLE: 7 segment display with potentiometer

* Goal

  Build a simple circuit that takes a potentiometer as an input and
  ouputs values on a single character 7 segment display.

* Schematics

* The assembly

Now here is what it looks like in person:

* Use of the map function

  Arduino's [[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/math/map/][=map=]] function allows to map a number from one range to
  another. For example:

  #+BEGIN_SRC C
  /* Value = 5 here */
  long value = map (50, 0, 100, 0, 10);
  #+END_SRC

  This is a very useful function when dealing with analog input to
  control anything.
